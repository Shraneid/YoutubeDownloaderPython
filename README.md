# YoutubeDownloaderPython
Simple python script to download youtube videos from a certain range (actually download the whole video and then crops it and automatically deletes leftovers)

## Installation
git clone this repo, you need python 3 installed 
and then run the command 
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage 
launch the python main file and enter what it asks

I recommend using https://ytcutter.com/ to preview the timestamps before inputting them into the script as it is pretty well done
